# DPG SKM 2025 Tutorial: AI Fundamentals for Research (joint session BP/TUT/DY/AKPIK)

 Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an essential tool in modern physics, enabling new approaches to data analysis, modeling, and prediction. This hands-on tutorial provides an accessible introduction to key AI concepts, emphasizing their practical applications in physics research.

Materials in this repository are also downloadable by clicking [this link.](https://jlubox.uni-giessen.de/getlink/fiAGRzcGTiCL3GZxk8WAjom4/)

Participants are encouraged to download the contents of this repository ahead of time.

Organized by Jan Bürger (Aachen), Janine Graser (Duisburg), Robin Msiska (Duisburg/Ghent), and Arash Rahimi-Iman (Gießen), with support from Stefan Klumpp (Göttingen) and Tim Ruhe (Dortmund).

## Getting Started on Your Own Device
If you have not yet downloaded this repository, you can do so in two ways. 
1. If you have `git` installed on your device, you can use the command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RedMechanism/DPG-SKM-2025-Tutorial-AI-Fundamentals-for-Research.git
    ```
2. If you do not have `git`, go to the main page of the GitHub repository, click the green button labelled "Code" close to the top of the page, and then select `Download ZIP`. Unzip the archive.

    Alternatively, you can download this archive by clicking [this external link.](https://jlubox.uni-giessen.de/getlink/fiAGRzcGTiCL3GZxk8WAjom4/)


After downloading the repository, navigate to its folder (which contains the `requirements.txt` file). Then, create and activate a Python virtual environment. Once the environment is active, install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you're unsure how to create or activate a virtual environment, please refer to the [instructions here](creating_environment.md).

Finally, test your setup by running the `pyteser.py` script within the activated environment. Using the command
```bash
python pyteser.py
```
or
```bash
python3 pyteser.py
```
## Using the Online Notebooks
If you're unable to set up a working environment on your own machine, you may opt to use an online environment for Jupyter Notebooks. To do so, simply click on the badge corresponding to the desired Jupyter Notebook below. Access details for this online environment will be provided during the session.
